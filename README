Copilot Key Exorciser for Linux - turn it back into a proper CTRL

Edit copilot.cpp and make sure DEVICE_PATH points to the correct input
device for your laptop keyboard. Then:

    make
    sudo setkeycodes 6e 193
    sudo ./exorcise-copilot

If it works, you're in luck - arrange for it to run at boot time.

Combinations involving left Shift/Meta + right Ctrl will work, but not
perfectly. At least on my hardware (ASUS M5606WA) I have the following
issues (where by MOD I mean either Left Shift, Left Meta, or both, and
by CTRL I mean the damned Copilot key):

- MOD↓ CTRL↓ — if you press both at the exact same time, it's possible
  that only Right Ctrl will register.

- MOD↓ CTRL↓ CTRL↑ — even if your MOD is still physically down, the
  hardware emits a MOD↑ event when you release CTRL, and we let it go
  through; the reason for that is that there will no longer be a MOD↑
  event when you actually release it (you can use evtest to check it
  out), and it would remain "down", as far as software is concerned,
  until you press and release it again. This is so horrible that it
  took me quite some time to even write it down.

Remember folks, I've been saying this for 20 years: Microsoft is evil.
